MACCS fingerprints (MACCS, 166 bits) were calculated by PaDEL-Descriptor, to develop machine learning models. PaDEL is a powerful chemical informatics software that can calculate a variety of molecular descriptors, including Pubchem fingerprint, Substructure fingerprint, and MACCS molecular fingerprints, that can obtain the unique characteristics of the molecule. It uses binary coding to dectect and represent certain substructures in the molecule.
